Dwimmer is an experiment.

It started as a blog engine with this screencast: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGX5pgKWVoc
but since then it is all kinds of things.

For example it is a wiki, a CMS, a planet...
or a beginnnig of either of those.

Mostly it is an experiment to write some stuff.

=================================================
Setup:

If you already have a CPAN enabled perl installed then type "cpan Dwimmer" in your command prompt.
