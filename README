Dwimmer is an experiment.

It started as a blog engine with this screencast: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGX5pgKWVoc
but since then it is all kinds of things.

For example it is a wiki, a CMS, a planet...
or a beginnnig of either of those.

Mostly it is an experiment to write some stuff.

=================================================
Setup:

If you already have a CPAN enabled perl installed then type "cpan Dwimmer" in your command prompt.
If you don't have perl yet then we have a binary packaged version for windows. Install Dwimperl.

dwimmer_setup.pl --password ADMIN_PASSWORD --email email-of-admin@company.com --root path/to/your/installation 

------------
Upgrade:

cpan Dwimmer 

dwimmer_setup.pl --password ADMIN_PASSWORD --root path/to/your/installation --upgrade


Markup language
=====================
- Use a very simple markup language and allow any HTML.
  [linkname]
  [linkname link title]
  [schema://specialcase]
  [schema://specialcase link title]

- When arriving at a page that does not exist yet,
  display this info and if the user is logged in then offer the page
  to be edited/created.

- From the web site allow the creation of a site with basic usage.
  - At first only the admin can create sites but later we might allow
    regular users as well to create sites using the main site.
